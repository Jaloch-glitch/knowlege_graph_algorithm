# To consume a project as a contributor (a fellow developer), you would take the following steps:

## 1. Fetch the project from GitHub.
## 2. Create a virtual environment and place yourself in it.
## 3. Restore the project by using pip install -r requirements.txt. It will look for requirements.txt and fetch and install the packages listed for that file.
## 4. Run your app.
